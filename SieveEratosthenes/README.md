Algorithm:

1-Write all the numbers from 2 to N
2-Set/Mark the number 2 to TRUE(prime number) and set all the multiplies to FALSE(non prime)
3-Find the smaller Non Marked number(for example m) and Set it to TRUE and set all the multiplies to FALSE
4-Repeat 3 until we can not find a non marked number m<=N
5-The TRUE ones marked are Primes
