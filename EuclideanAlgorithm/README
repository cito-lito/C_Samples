WIKIPEDIA: "In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm, or Euclid's algorithm, 
is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, 
the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. 
It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, 
who first described it in his Elements (c. 300 BC)..."


-This is an Example of the implementation of the Euclidian Algorithm using recursion:

– if a = b, then GDC(a, b) = a.
– if a < b, then GDC(a, b − a).
– if b < a, then GDC(a − b, b).

-You can set the limit of Operations by modifieng the preprocesor constan MAX_ITERATIONS on the ggt.h file
